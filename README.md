ğŸš€ Master Data Analysis & Dashboarding with Tableau! ğŸš€

I recently created a Comprehensive HR analytics dashboard in Tableau, diving deep into data visualisation and insights. This project covers key concepts like: 

âœ… Calculated measures & custom columns
âœ… Creating histograms & box plots
âœ… Customizing visuals
âœ… Working with "Marks" 
âœ… Field formatting
âœ… Filters, Actions and using "Context"
âœ… Cumulative totals & contextual formatting 
âœ… Building a powerful HR Dashboard

Using a sample HR employee dataset of awesome chocolates, I explored: 

ğŸ“Š How many people are in each Job?  
ğŸ“Š Gender distribution
ğŸ“Š Age spread of our staff
ğŸ“Š Which jobs pay more?
ğŸ“Š Top earners by job
ğŸ“Š Qualification vs. Salary
ğŸ“Š Staff growth trend in the last 5 years
ğŸ“Š Employee filter by starting letter
ğŸ“Š Leave balance analysis
ğŸ“Š Quick HR Dashboard
